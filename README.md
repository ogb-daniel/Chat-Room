# Realtime Chat App ðŸ’¬
And yes it greets you in spanish....just felt like adding that.
You gotta check it out tho,For now just storing messages in arrays,implement database soon.
Built with React,Node and Socket.io
#How it works
Enter with a username,then and a room you wish to use
If u want to chat with friend tell them to use the same room you created....that easyðŸ¥±
Note.....since i am using arrays for now,if u refresh or close the browser your chats are history.ðŸ™‚
